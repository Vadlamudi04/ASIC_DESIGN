<summary><strong>Lab Session 1</strong></summary>

### Objective:
We need to compile and verify a basic C code of sum to numbers from 1 to n using GCC and by using RISC-V GNU compiler toolchain on Ubuntu, then compare the outputs.

### Tools required:
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- RISC-V GNU Compiler

### Procedure:

### Task1: Compile and verify using GCC Compiler:
1. **Code to create a texteditor**
   ```
   leafpad 1tonsum.c
   ```
    
2. **Code Snippet for finding sum of first n numbers:**

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main() {
        int i;int sum=0;int n=100;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
          sum+=i;
        }
        printf("Sum to numbers from 1 to %d is %d\n",n,sum);
        return 0;
    }
    ```
3. **Command for compiling the above code in terminal using GCC compiler:**
   ```
   gcc 1tonsum.c
   ```
4. **Command for getting output:**
   ```c
   ./a.out
   ```
5. **Output:**
   ```c
   Sum to numbers from 1 to 100 is 5050
   ```

### Task2: Compile and verify using RISC-V GNU Compiler and optimize the compilation using O1,Ofast,O2 and O3:

#### Using O1 optimization:

1. **Command for compiling the code using  RISC-V GCC compiler using O1 optimization:**
   ```c
   riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o 1tonsum.o 1tonsum.c
   ```
   **Result:** This creates an object file "1tonsum.o"

3. **Command for getting the assembly language code:**
   ```c
   riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d 1tonsum.o | less
   ```
   **Result:**  As soon as you enter the above command, a huge list of opcode is shown in the terminal.
   But we are interested in main section of the program so type : /main 
4. **Obseravtion:**
   
   ![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af0fd908-3d5d-4fd3-b7e1-d2dc56efc951)

   There are 15 lines of opcode in the main section.

#### Using Ofast optimization:

1. **Command for compiling the code using  RISC-V GCC compiler using -Ofast optimization:**
   ```c
   riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o 1tonsum.o 1tonsum.c
   ```
   **Result:** This creates an object file "1tonsum.o"
   
   ![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35cf5501-0d07-43af-a492-55ac1765d998)

3. **Command for getting the assembly language code:**
   ```c
   riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d 1tonsum.o | less
   ```
   **Result:**  As soon as you enter the above command, a huge list of opcode is shown in the terminal.
   But we are interested in main section of the program so type : /main 
4. **Obseravtion:**
   
   ![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b63d5c8-4618-497e-a036-588297b97d47)

   There are 12 lines of opcode in the main section.
   
### Results:

   ![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6846d35c-1aee-4997-be56-750b753b8c9b)

1. There are 15 lines of opcode in the main section for O1.
2. There are 12 lines of opcode in the main section for Ofast.
3. There are 12 lines of opcode in the main section for O2.
4. There are 12 lines of opcode in the main section for O3.

**Hence Compilation using O1 optimization takes the most number of instructions(most time).**
